# 📄 Resume Guide: Impact Over Activity

> **Credit**: This guide is based on the methodology by [Lucy Gilmour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucygilmour-careercoach/), career strategy coach and job search expert.

Demonstrated success in [key achievement with numbers] and [another achievement with metrics]. 
Seeking to leverage expertise in [specific skills] to drive results for [target company/role].
```

## Impact-Driven Examples
