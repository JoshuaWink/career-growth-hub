> **Credit**: This guide is based on the methodology by [Lucy Gilmour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucygilmour-careercoach/), career strategy coach and job search expert.

## Core Philosophy
Following Lucy's approach: **Tell a business story, not list responsibilities.**

## Professional Summary Template
```
[Job Title] with [X] years of experience, delivering [specific metric] impact in [industry/domain]. 
Demonstrated success in [key achievement with numbers] and [another achievement with metrics]. 
Seeking to leverage expertise in [specific skills] to drive results for [target company/role].
```

## Impact-Driven Examples

### ‚ùå Weak Bullets (Before)
- Responsible for frontend development
- Managed team projects
- Improved application performance

### ‚úÖ Strong Bullets (After)
- Led frontend redesign resulting in 40% faster load times and 25% increase in user engagement
- Managed 5-person development team, delivering 3 major projects $100K under budget
- Optimized database queries reducing API response time by 60% across 200K daily requests

## Rules for Resume Success
1. Every bullet must show measurable impact
2. No soft skills (e.g., "team player", "hard worker")
3. Quantify achievements with metrics
4. Tailor your story to the specific role
5. Focus on outcomes, not responsibilities

## Achievement Formula
[Action Verb] + [Specific Task] + [Measurable Result]

Example: "Redesigned customer onboarding flow, reducing dropout rate by 35% and increasing conversion by $2M annually"

## Metrics to Track & Highlight
- Revenue generated/saved
- Time saved/efficiency gained
- User/customer impact
- Team size managed
- Project scope/budget
- Performance improvements
- Error rate reductions

## Example Technical Achievement
```markdown
Senior Software Engineer, TechCorp (2020-2024)
- Architected microservices infrastructure supporting 1M+ daily users
- Reduced cloud costs by 45% through optimization of AWS resources
- Led adoption of React.js, resulting in 30% faster development cycles
- Mentored 4 junior developers who achieved promotion within 12 months
```

Remember: Your resume is a business case for hiring you, not a history of your jobs.
